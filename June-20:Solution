Group Balls by Sequence
Solution:
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def validgroup(self, arr, k):
        # Step 1: Check if total balls can be divided into groups of k
        if len(arr) % k != 0:
            return False
        
        # Step 2: Count frequency of each ball number
        freq = Counter(arr)

        # Step 3: Sort the keys (ball numbers)
        for num in sorted(freq):
            count = freq[num]
            if count > 0:
                # Try to form a group starting from current number
                for i in range(num, num + k):

                        return False
                    freq[i] -= count
