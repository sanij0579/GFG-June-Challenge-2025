Lexicographically Largest String After K Deletions
Solution:
class Solution:
    def maxSubseq(self, s, k):
        n = len(s)
        keep = n - k  # We need to keep n - k characters
        stack = []

        for ch in s:
            # Remove smaller chars from the end if possible
            while stack and k > 0 and stack[-1] < ch:
                stack.pop()
                k -= 1
            stack.append(ch)

        # We might have more than required, slice it
        result = ''.join(stack[:keep])
        return result
